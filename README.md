### **Hello, I'm @gracieze or Gracie lol**

I am a 2nd year CS student.

Some of my hobbies include practicing 3D modeling, taking care of my plants, playing video games, and jumping from hobby to hobby.
One of my personal projects right now is a tomodachi cat game.
One of my favorite games right now is Genshin Impact. My dog is named after Danny Devito :)

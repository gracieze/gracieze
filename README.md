### **Hello, I'm @gracieze or Gracie lol**

I am a 2nd year CS student.

Some of my hobbies include practicing 3D modeling, taking care of my houseplants, playing video games, and jumping from hobby to hobby.
One of my personal projects is a Roblox RPG that I am creating from scratch.

Fun Fact; My dog is named after Danny Devito :)

### **Hello, I'm @gracieze, or Gracie lol**

I am a 2nd year CS student at Clemson University.

Some of my hobbies include practicing 3D modeling, taking care of my houseplants, playing video games, and creating art. Currently, personal project is an RPG Roblox game from scratch.

Fun Fact; My dog is named after Danny Devito :)
